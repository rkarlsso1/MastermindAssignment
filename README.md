# Mastermind Assignment

This is a **basic Mastermind game** built with a **production-style design** to showcase **Object-Oriented Programming** principles. 
Instead of just throwing all logic into one file, the code is split into classes and interfaces for flexibility and maintainability — maybe a bit beyond what’s needed for this type of coding exercise.
I even snuck in a little LINQ just to spice things up. 


## Why so “overengineered”?

- **OOP Showcase**  
  This is far from the simplest or most efficent way to solve this problem, but I decided to take the opportunity to demonstrate production-like use of abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
- **Scalability**  
  Not that it's overly useful, but I made it so you could easily swap different code generators, guess evaluators, or change settings for the rules of the game. Again, for the purpose of making it more production-like.
- **Clean Structure**  
  Organized folders and a clear architecture mimic how real-world applications are structured.

  Thank you!
